# Form-Validation
This is a signup form for a fictional conference. I completed this project using vanilla JavaScript. This is a dynamic form that allows users to input various data and receive feedback on what they have input. If a user does not enter correct data, the form will be prevented from submitting by checking user inputs against RegEx values. The user is then notified of the data that they did not correctly enter through a list of error messgaes below the submit button and a red border on the section that is incorrect. 

If the user does not have JavaScript functioning on their browser, the form will still function. All JavaScript is mine and some minor changes to the HTML and CSS.
